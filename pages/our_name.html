      <h1>Our Name - The Zeroth Law</h1>

      <p>Isaac Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century; over the course of his lifetime he
        published over 500 books spanning a wide genre of literature - but is most known for his 3 science fiction
        series, "Foundation", "Empire", and "Robot" which span over 14 volumes and <em>were not written in chronological
          order</em> - meaning that as Asimov's expansive mind stitched together the fabric of a futuristic galactic
        civilization over the course of 50 years he occasionally had to go back and "insert" critical elements into his
        timeline. It's a classic example of the revision of one's "first principles" to reach a specific outcome once
        that outcome has been clearly defined. In other words, to get to the ending he wanted he had to introduce
        foundational elements to the beginnings.</p>

      <p>In the 1940s Asimov first introduced a set of rules intended to govern the behavior of robots within his
        novels. The laws are as follows:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
        <li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first
          law.</li>
        <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first and
          second laws <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>, <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Asimov later added a "Zeroth Law," which stated that <strong>"a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction,
          allow humanity to come to harm"</strong>. Though he first postulated this law early on, it wasn't until 1985
        (near the end of his life) that he inserted it into his timeline. The idea that technology must act in the best
        interest of humanity as a whole superseding the interest of an individual has had profound effects on the way
        that Asimov's characters (both humans and robots) interact - it has a profound effect on the way that we view
        technology today.</p>

      <p>His framework is what many of the AI alignment scholars have built their thesis on... Many (including Asimov)
        argue that the laws should apply to anything that follows a rational logic - including humans (though he points
        out that humans are not always rational).</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: left;">At Zeroth Technology we embrace Asimov's zeroth law in two ways:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>In how the law was derived - the idea that there are primitives that are required to reach a desired
          outcome, but that we may not know those primitives when we start.</li>
        <li>In what the law stands for - the belief that any technological advancement needs to be built in such a way
          that it does no harm to humanity, and that protecting humanity supersedes protecting individual interests.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>This is the basis of our philosophy - we invest in, or in some cases help build, technological primitives that
        become the foundation for systems that will benefit humanity and actively prevent harm from coming to us.</p>
