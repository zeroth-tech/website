    <h1>Introducing Aesop: Optimizing Your Knowledge for AI</h1>

    <img src="/aesop_assets/aesop-serif.jpg" alt="Aesop Header Image">

    <p class="intro">
      Aesop is known for his fables â€“ One of the most famous, the ant and the grasshopper, teaches us the value of
      preparation vs. living life in the moment. While the grasshopper is chasing shiny things and looking for quick
      fixes, the ant is plodding away getting ready for winter.
    </p>

    <p>New technological breakthroughs often cause companies to act like grasshoppers and disregard the work of the
      ants. The promise (and hype) of AI has caused many leaders to push the technology on their organizations. But
      these changes have come so fast that few, if any, large organizations are actually prepared to use it.</p>

    <p>It all comes down to data, and no matter how advanced the technology is, the output is only as good as the data
      you feed in. If Aesop were around today, he would likely share a story about "garbage in equals garbage out", and
      if he were to use Chat-GPT to write it he might warn against the risks of "garbage in equals gospel out".</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>

    <p>We designed Aesop to be a methodology that helps you prepare the knowledge within your organization to be
      optimized so that AI can assist you in a trusted, reliable manner. Perhaps ironically, Aesop does this by using AI
      to challenge your current knowledge base and find the areas that will cause various models to fail. In this
      process we iterate through your knowledge with your experts and produce clean documentation and data that
      accurately represents your organization as new models are being trained.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>For most organizations their knowledge is captured in a complex web of policies, procedures, processes and
        trainings. In many industries this level of knowledge management is supported by large teams and can span the
        globe. This, of course, leads to inconsistency and redundancy in documentation; and in many cases our "effective
        SOPs" have long passed their expiration date. It should be no surprise that an AI model trained on such
        procedures might provide inaccurate answers, or even worse hallucinate an answer that "sounds really good".</p>
    </div>

    <p>Aesop addresses the root of the problem by focusing on improving the quality and reliability of your data and
      procedural records before you apply AI. Think of it as the preparation the ant takes to clean up his house and
      inventory his supplies before stocking up for winter.</p>

    <h2>How Does Aesop Work?</h2>

    <p>Aesop is not a tool; it is a methodology supported by technology that helps you create and/or update knowledge
      documents that are optimized for AI. We do this by following a set of principles:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start With the End in Mind:</strong> Your knowledge documents represent your organization your
        culture, your priorities, your values - they should not be generated from off the shelf templates. Aesop starts
        by understanding what is important to you - this can be as easy as a "golden template SOP" or a reimagining of
        your knowledge management.</li>
      <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop:</strong> While Aesop leverages AI to enhance your documentation, we never lose
        sight of the importance of human oversight. Accountability stays where it belongs-with the Process Owner. Aesop
        works alongside your team, keeping the human element front and center. This means you still get that crucial
        context and detailed info that only comes from real conversations with experts.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridging the Experience Gap:</strong> While documentation is never a substitute for experience, good
        documentation is an accelerator. Aesop attempts to bridge this gap by expanding the source data from existing
        documentation and data to include in the views with relevant experts and process owners. The output of those
        interviews is fed back into the generation of the updated procedures.</li>
      <li><strong>Precision and Accuracy Supported by Context:</strong> Aesop prioritizes precision and accuracy over
        brevity. Our goal is to provide clear, reliable documentation that can easily be referenced within context. This
        often means more verbose documentation to provide the right amount of context so that a reference can stand on
        its own.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero Hallucinations:</strong> One of our core goals with Aesop is "zero hallucinations." When the AI
        doesn't know something, it doesn't guess-it asks for more context or flags the need for additional data. This
        keeps your processes grounded in reality, preventing costly mistakes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Aesop Technology Stack</h2>

    <p>As a methodology supported by technology it follows that we have a technology stack. Given the rapid pace of
      advancement in LLMs we are constantly swapping out models for ones that help us achieve better results, so our
      tech stack is modular, and we have several deployment models. We treat each engagement as a separate environment
      and remove all installations once the output is produced.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Source Documentation Repository:</strong> Where you drop the files / data sets that are to be used as
        inputs. This can remain behind your firewall if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>LLMs and Vision Models:</strong> This is a menu of models that we select from once we understand the
        source documents and desired outputs. They are primarily open-sourced models that we deploy locally, but we can
        also use any enterprise APIs that you might have available.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesop Prompting:</strong> Our intelligent prompt generation module that we use to interrogate source
        documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesop Interview:</strong> Our unique approach to guiding process owners during an interview to fill
        the gaps in procedural documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesop User Interface:</strong> A novel way for your experts to review the proposed documentation and
        accept, reject, or improve responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Output Documentation Repository:</strong> Where we store the newly generated knowledge document and
        any additional supporting requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use Aesop and What Does It Cost?</h2>

    <p>As a methodology Aesop is best used by service providers who understand their client's business. The outputs are
      knowledge documents that are free from reliance on the Aesop tooling and the execution environment requires
      maintenance and upkeep; it is logical that a service provider bear this cost so they can achieve economies of
      scale. To that end expect the pricing to be what you typically pay your service provider for such work.</p>

    <p>If your organization has an internal knowledge management team Aesop can be deployed locally, and Zeroth
      Technology will provide training, maintenance, and licensable versions of the Aesop specific software.</p>

    <h2>The Aesop Advantage</h2>

    <p>Aesop is designed to elevate the quality of your existing procedures, documents, and datasets, ensuring that your
      foundation is strong enough to support advanced technologies like LLMs and intelligent knowledge retrieval
      systems. Even if use of those systems is not on your horizon, the Aesop advantage makes sense because it delivers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Referenceable Documentation:</strong> Aesop transforms your knowledge documents into reliable,
        easy-to-use documentation with consistent formatting and concise wording. This makes them not only user-friendly
        but also ready for integration with future technologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Eliminating Contradictions:</strong> Consistency across multiple sources is one of the biggest
        challenges in procedural documentation. Aesop identifies and resolves contradictions, ensuring your records are
        clear, aligned, and free of conflicting information.</li>
      <li><strong>Reducing Repetition:</strong> Redundant information clutters your documentation and increases the risk
        of errors. Aesop streamlines your records by eliminating unnecessary repetition, making your procedures more
        efficient and easier to follow.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensuring Accuracy + Precision:</strong> Provides clear and reliable documentation with the right
        amount of context that can stand alone and stand up to scrutiny.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By addressing these critical aspects of knowledge management, Aesop tackles the "not exciting but incredibly
      important" foundation that positions your organization for future success. This proactive approach, much like the
      ant in Aesop's fable, prepares you for the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p>

    <p>When you implement AI and other advanced technologies, you'll be building on a strong, reliable foundation of
      well-organized, consistent, and accurate information. The Aesop method prepares you with the foresight of the ant,
      enabling your organization to not just weather challenges but to thrive and enjoy its days in the sun.</p>

    <p>Investing in Aesop now sets your organization up for a future where your knowledge base is not just a repository
      of information, but a strategic asset that can be leveraged effectively with emerging technologies. This
      forward-thinking approach to knowledge management can provide a competitive edge in an increasingly AI-driven
      business landscape, positioning you to leverage relevant technological advancements as they emerge.</p>
