    <div class="the_issue">
        <p>It's hard to know what to trust these days and it going to get harder.</p>
        <p>Being able to distinguish between and authentic and generative is already a blurred line.</p>
        <p>Thankfully deep fakes are still in the realm of "video production" meaning that they are generated and then released to the public.</p>
        <p>Fake live streaming with real-time filters is around the corner.</p>
        <p>This means that the person on your favorite streaming live cast might not be who you think they are...</p>
        <p>or the colleague in your zoom meeting is an imposter...</p>
        <p>or the government official making a public address is not just a political puppet, but someone else entirely!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="what_is_true">
        <p>What makes a live stream authentic anyway? </p>
        <p>For broadcast media we rely on the producers and reporters to display legitimate content. </p>
        <p>For narrowcast media we rely on the reputation of the presenter</p>
        <p>This means we need to trust in two things:</p>
            <p>1) *Identity Attestation*: The producer or presenter is who they claim to be and is willing to put their reputation on the line.</p>
            <p>2) *Contemporaneousness*: The content being shared as "live" is in fact happening now (or at least within a few seconds of lag time)</p>
