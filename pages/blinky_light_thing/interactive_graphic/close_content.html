        The close step is optional but adds a tremendous about of credibility to the future use of your presentation.  Here we repeat the process of creating the preparation attestation, but this time we simply create a closing attestation that references the first one.  This effectively bookend your broadcast between two attestations making it very hard for someone to make changes in between.</p>

        As an added step the raw video of your broadcast can be hashed and the hash included in your closing attestation, making it nearly impossible for someone to alter the video after the fact.  This added step can add some processing time to the the closing attestation (hashing videos can be computationally intense).  If the video is to be edited afterward, the closed hashed content makes a great starting point for something like C2PA.
