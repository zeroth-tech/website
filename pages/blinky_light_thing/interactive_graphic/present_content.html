        When you are ready to present make sure your phone is paired to your BLT.  With our recommended configuration a constant red light means not connected, a constant blue light means it is.  Once you click "start blinking" on your phone the message will start to broadcast.  Position the BLT so that the light reflects off of your face, but not in a way that is distracting - your message is being transmitted.

        <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Warning</h4>
        <p>It goes without saying that the blinky light thing blinks... please, please, please if strobing or blinking lights effect you in a negative way DO NOT USE THE BLT.  A more detailed disclaimer is included below.</a> </p>

        Now you can now show your audience the QR code. Here you have the option to share the EAS UID QR code directly and let your audience plug it into their verification tool of choice, or you can incorporate it into a link that routes them to a pre-configured verification tool which will accesses the UID and pull in the BLT configurations automatically.  Depending on the tool the audience uses they will see continuous confirmation that the message being broadcast included an encoded message from the blinky light matches your attestation.

        Our tests show an optimal blink rate of 0.2 seconds (200 milliseconds) - so you need to present for at least 51 seconds to transmit a full message...
