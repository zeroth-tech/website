        Proving is done by applying a vectorscope to your streaming video to detect the spikes in blue light being transmitted from the BLT.  Applying a filter to the video that enhances the hue can make the blinking light very apparent, but that isn't necessary for the BLT to work. A sampling of the vectorscope is taken every 50 milliseconds to determine if the blue light is on or off.  50 milliseconds is slightly higher than the typical frame rate of 30 frames per second (33.3 ms) and less than our recommended blink rate of 200 giving us some buffer to account for missed frames or lag time. </p>

        The BLT is blinking out the encoded UID of your attestation.  That same UID has been passed to the verification tool to use as a baseline to detect against.  By plotting the sample against the expected value we are able to determine if the decoded message (that which is blinked) matches the encoded message (that which is known). Before the BLT begins the message it blinks the red LED three times to indicate the start of a transmission (this helps us sync up the timing).  When we plot the blinks over time it looks like this:

    <p>From time to time there will be false positives, where the vectorscope detects the light when it wasn't on or vice versa. We are still fine tuning the verification process, but we believe that any message with a match rate of greater than 75% can safely be considered to be legitimate</p>
