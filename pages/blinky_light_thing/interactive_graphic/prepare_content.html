        First you need a BLT - we recommend you build one yourself (we are working on a step-by-step guide) or you can ask us for one; just cover parts and shipping and we got you covered.  You can also use your phone as the light source (but it doesn't work as well...).</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A session starts by making an attestation from an account that is provably yours - this is some form of digital identity that uses a blockchain.  The attestation must include the blink rate you are using and just a few other elements that make it easier to decode.  We've predefined a schema on Ethereum Attestation Services to make this easier for you - it looks like this: </p>
    <br>
        <code padding="10px">
            fullName : "James Canterbury"; <i> optional</i><br>
            messageColor: "BLUE"; <i> recommended</i> <br> 
            terminationColor: "RED"; <i> recommended</i> <br> 
            blinkRate: "200"; in milliseconds <i> required</i> <br> 
            description: "some extra text here" <i> optional</i> <br>
        </code> <br>
    <p>
        The attestation returns a 64 character hexidecimal string which both serves as a pointer to the attestation and a unique ID that would be impossible to determine ahead of time.</p>

    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip</h4>
    <div class="info">Creating the attestation using your wallet proves that it is the authentic you (assuming you control your keys and have used some form of proof of personhood). The UID of the attestation uses the time stamp of the Ethereum block in which the attestation is posted - proving that your session is contemporaneous.</div>

    <p>At this point if you know the URL for your live stream you can bundle the UID, blink rate, LED colors and your live stream link into one convenient URL which you can share with your audience.  If that sounds like a lot, you can use our <a href=./BLT_Create.html> BLT Create Site </a></p>
