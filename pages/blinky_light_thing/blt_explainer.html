    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Blinky Light Thing:</h1>
    <h3><i>(that's the technical term)</i></h3>
    <br>
    <h2>The Issue</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">It's hard to know what to trust these days and it going to get harder.
        Being able to distinguish between and authentic and generative is already a blurred line.
        Thankfully deep fakes are still in the realm of "video production" meaning that they are generated and 
        then released to the public.</p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">Fake live streaming with real-time filters is around the corner.
        This means that the person on your favorite streaming live cast might not be who you think they are... 
        or the colleague in your zoom meeting is an imposter... 
        or the government official making a public address is not just a political puppet, but someone else entirely!</p>
    
    <h2>What is true?</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">What makes a live stream authentic anyway?
        For broadcast media we rely on the producers and reporters to display legitimate content.
        For narrowcast media we rely on the reputation of the presenter. Even if the content they are producing is not true,
        for us to believe them we have to "know" who they are. And if we are talking about live streaming, we also need to know that
        it is live. <br>
        <p style="margin-left:15px">This means we need to trust in two things:</p>
        <ul class = "custom-list">
          <li class="custom-list-item"><span style="color:lime">Identity Authenticity</span>: The producer or presenter is who they claim to be and is willing to put their reputation on the line.</li>
          <li class="custom-list-item"><span style="color:lime">Contemporaneousness</span>: The content being shared as "live" is in fact happening now (or at least within the last few seconds)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">A live deep fake is accomplished by applying a real time filter - the same technology that can make
        you look like a cat or a talking pickle can also let you "wear" somebody else.  The live stream will look and 
        sound like someone you know and trust, but it will be someone else entirely.  These filters are accomplished by using software to map the facial and/or body movements of an actor onto a model of the target. And while they can do this very well, they do struggle (at least for now) with changes in the physical environment.</p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">Our goal with the blinky light thing (technically called the BLT) is to introduce elements of  cryptography into the physical environment that is being recorded by video capture devices.  This lets us bake cryptographic messages into the raw video and audio feed of the broadcast which become really difficult to modify later on.  Our intent is prove the broadcast is both authentic and contemporaneous. We do this by obtaining a unique ID from <a href="attest.org"> Ethereum Attestation Services</a> (EAS) and then broadcasting that UID by blinking a light during the live stream.  With a little bit of vectorscope magic anyone watching the video can decode the message and match it to the attestation.  Here's a short video that explains it better </p>

      <h2>Our intent</h2>
      <p class="indented-paragraph"> 
        We built the BLT for you to use it.  We will always give options for it's use free of charge (or at least as minimal as the gas fees for making an attestation).  
        <br> If you like it &rarr;  you can buy us a cup of coffee.  
        <br> If you want to incorporate it into your day-to-day &rarr; we are working on some services to make it super easy for you to use.  
        <br> If you are not into web3 ("crypto wallet what?") &rarr; we will also have services to cover you.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented-paragraph"> 
        We look at all the damage and mis-information that can be caused by deep fake streaming and we hope that the BLT can help make a dent in preventing it.  We know it's not perfect and we know that blinking a light in your face is not for everyone (see disclaimer below) but we hope that this will spark some additional ideas and begin to merge digital identity, cryptography, and networks to provide a safer more trusted future.  We are open sourcing the construction and all of the source code for the BLT.  We have purposely chosen other open source softwares such as EAS so that anyone can build and use one. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented-paragraph"> 
        Our <a href="/pages/blinky_light_thing/blt_create_web_app.html">Create BLT </a> site is free to use, though we are working on a version that will have a small fee for bundling the message, and we plan to offer services for those who do not have a wallet by which they can connect to EAS.  If you want to buy a BLT pre-built please complete <a href="tbd">this form</a>.  They cost about $25 USD to build and ship - we accept payment in ETH or OP our address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xFD98DECDDD9F0cF205e5cB40fe61a6CAF8De59A5">zerothtech.eth</a>
        </p>
        <br>
      <p class="indented-paragraph"> 
        It is core to our design that the verification of a video that uses a BLT should <i>always</i> be free and there should be <i>multiple</i> independent ways to verify.  Our <a href="/pages/blinky_light_thing/blt_verify_web_app.html">BLT verify</a> site is provided as one such option, it is our hope that in the future others will do the same. </p>
