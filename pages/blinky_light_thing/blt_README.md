# BLT Read Me
There are two pages to the BLT site.  BLT_Index is a webpage explaining what the heck BLT is. BLT_Run_BLE is the site where people can create an attestation and transmit the value to their BLT using Web Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).  BLT_Run_Web is a web only version of the BLE that will cause the browser to blink out the attestation message.

## Dev Notes

### BLT Index

    TODO:
    [ ] update "tiles"
    [ ] remove references to audio chirping (save that for a V2!)

### BLT_Run_BLE
