# Zeroth Technology

## Company Overview

Zeroth Technology is a company building foundations of trust for our digital world. We work at the intersection of trust and emergent technologies including blockchain and AI, creating products that facilitate connectivity between knowledge and identity.

## Core Mission

In the convergence of physical and digital worlds, Zeroth Technology builds technology that enables trust through:
- Cryptography
- Decentralized information networks
- Self-sovereign identity
- Trustable context

Our belief: The most important work is applying technology that facilitates connectivity between knowledge and identity.

## Company Name Origin

Named after Isaac Asimov's "Zeroth Law of Robotics": "A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm." This law supersedes the three traditional laws of robotics and represents:
1. The need for foundational primitives that may not be initially apparent but are crucial for desired outcomes
2. The principle that technological advancement must protect humanity as a whole, superseding individual interests

## Core Principles

- Building solid foundations for equal footing to everyone and everything
- Contributing to public goods and open source projects
- Transparency in revenue models, research, and work
- "wagmi" (we're all gonna make it) - collective success mindset

## Technical Approach

Zeroth Technology operates across three main areas:
1. Core technology development
2. Product creation
3. Services and use cases

All work focuses on the intersection of trust and emergent technologies.

## Vision for the Future

Knowledge → Trust → Reputation → Identity

This chain represents how in the digital age:
- Vast, accessible knowledge will transform everything we do
- Building, sharing, and verifying knowledge is paramount
- Trust requires knowing who you're interacting with
- Reputation becomes the foundation for all interactions (human or AI)

## Philosophy

"Humanity is no longer at the crossroads between the physical and the digital — we are in the convergence."

Zeroth Technology believes in building the technological primitives that will serve as the foundation for systems benefiting humanity while actively preventing harm. Like Asimov's Foundation series, we recognize that achieving desired outcomes often requires establishing foundational elements that may not be immediately apparent at the start.
