      <h2>How do we Trust in the Digital Age</h2>
      
      <p>
        Humanity is no longer at the crossroads between the physical and the digital &mdash; 
        <span class="center-highlight-text">we are in the convergence.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This new era requires a different type of <span class="underlined">trust</span>.
        One that allows us to know who and what we are interacting with and 
        to have a shared understanding of what is true. One that creates accountability 
        and allows us to build reputations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the past, trust was built through experience and relationships.
        In the future, this will be no different &mdash; but in the digital world
        relationships are built through transactions, and experience leaves a trail.
        There is potential here to build much richer relationships and to establish trust
        that is rooted in proof.
      </p>
      
      <div class="plain-english">
        <p>
          We can do this through the combination of: 
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li style="text-align: left;">cryptography</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">decentralized information networks</li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">self-sovereign identity</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      
      <p></br>
        Our future is one of vast, accessible knowledge &mdash; it will transform the 
        way we do everything. But how we build, share, and verify that knowledge is 
        paramount to ensuring that transformation is for the better.
      </p>

      <p>
        It makes no difference if you are transacting with a human or an AI Agent, if you are 
        exchanging assets or knowledge &mdash; you must know who you are interacting with
        and you must rely on their reputation.
      </p>
      
      <div class="diagram-container">
        <img src="./assets/img/knowledge-graphic.svg" 
             alt="Diagram showing that knowledge is built on trust, trust is built on reputation, and reputation is built on identity" />

      </div>
      
      <p>
        Therefore we believe the most important work to be done is the application 
        of technology that facilitates this connectivity between knowledge and identity.

      <h2>Our Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Isaac Asimov told a story about how three simple hierarchical rules could govern the interobjective relationship
        between humans and robots; these were the 3 laws of robotics. He later realized that in order for humans and
        robots to reach their full potential (galactic civilization) he needed to include a zeroth law to supersede all
        others. And it was from this law (our namesake) that he built his foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Zeroth Technology, we are optimistic about our future, but we believe it needs a solid foundation which is set correctly to give equal footing to everyone and everything. By building products that apply the latest technologies we can demonstrate how our principles can be put into action.  We strive to contribute to public goods and open source projects that will change the world.  We are open and transparent with our revenue models, our research, and our work. </br>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>There are so many things we are passionate about and there is no way we can do it all. 
        We've organized our work into three strategic pillars under our parent company that we believe will help us achieve our goals.</p>
