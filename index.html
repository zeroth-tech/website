      <h2>Our thesis:</h2>
      <p>
        Humanity's reality is now a mixture of the physical and the digital, the authentic and the generative.<br>
        But where the physical world is bound by natural laws, the digital world is governed by rules we make up.<br>
        Those rules can be broken or changed - this is a problem.<br>
        We can fix this problem with math.<br>
        Just like the laws of nature can be described mathematically, we can create primary laws that supersede any
        other rules we create in the digital world. <br>
        In the physical world natural laws are part of the shared world around us; they apply to everyone equally.<br>
        In the digital world we need a common compute environment that does the math - the same way, for everyone, all
        of the time.<br>
        Blockchains are really good for this.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        But before we even get that far <br>
        we need to make sure that how we are being represented digitally is an accurate reflection of us. <br>
        This is the boring work of data cleansing and documentation - <br>
        but these are the "instructions" on which our future is being trained. <br>
        It is important to get it right.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Isaac Asimov told a story about how three simple hierarchical rules could govern the interobjective relationship
        between humans and robots; these were the 3 laws of robotics. He later realized that in order for humans and
        robots to reach their full potential (galactic civilization) he needed to include a zeroth law to supersede all
        others. And it was from this law (our namesake) that he built his foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Zeroth Technology we want that foundation to be set correctly and to give equal footing to everyone and
        everything.<br>
        We exist at the intersection of physical and digital, <br>
        we are driven to get the inputs right<br>
        and to discover those universal laws that can be encoded into decentralized networks and used as the foundation
        for future technology.
      </p>
      <p class="plain-english">What that means in plain English: We figure out how to use technology to keep both people
        and AIs honest.</p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>We know this is ambitious, but we are not in this alone. Zeroth Technology is committed to open research, open
        source solutions, and modular technology. We take on various projects that are aligned to our values and areas
        we can build out components of our overall vision.</p>
